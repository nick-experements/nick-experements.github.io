# I am Alsaac Muthagoras
I like programming. I am programming on Python, JavaScript and a bit on HTML. Here I collected some of my projects. In programing I am a beginner both on JavaScript and Python now, and on HTML I am almost a newcomer (that is what I said). 

A message for the future my self:
1. How many languages are you coding? Wich are they?
2. Do you like programming? Are you success?
3. Wish you more luck

## Here are my projects
